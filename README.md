# Sky Craft: 3D Gaussian Splatting and Real-Time Monitoring

SkyCraft is an AI-powered drone system designed to assist first responders in assessing infrastructure after natural disasters. Natural disasters often leave widespread destruction, and the critical 72-hour window for response requires rapid, accurate assessment of affected areas. SkyCraft tackles this challenge by creating precise 3D models of disaster zones to streamline emergency response efforts.

# Key Features
**3D Gaussian Splatting for Reconstruction**
* Utilized 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct highly accurate models of disaster-affected areas.
* Enabled detailed visualization and analysis of structural damage and terrain changes using drone-captured video data.

**Real-Time Environmental Monitoring**
* Implemented a Raspberry Pi-based system with a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity in real time.
* Developed a custom API to detect and alert for critical scenarios such as chemical leaks, fires, and the presence of warm bodies.
* Optimized for rapid deployment in disaster zones to improve situational awareness.

**Intuitive Web Application**
* Renders 3D models on user-friendly React application.
* Generates an AI summary from the drone-captured video for immediate insights.
